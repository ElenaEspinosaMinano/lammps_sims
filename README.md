### README for 3 models in 1st investigation

5300 atoms in total
- 5000 type 1, 2 + 3 (polymer beads: normal, very sticky, weakly sticky) - don't know how many of each :/
- 300 type 4 (proteins)


Model 1 - Proteins bind only to type 2 polymer beads with strong attraction 

Model 2 - Proteins bind strongly to type 2, and weakly to type 3 polymer beads 

Model 3 - Proteins bind strongly to type 2, weakly to type 3, and weakly to each other (type 4)

Model 4 - Proteins bind strongly to type 2, weakly to type 3, and with different attraction strength to each other (type 4) between 1k_BT and 8k_BT
